# Files

This directory contains a [sandbox](Sandbox.html) HTML file that loads (using requirejs)
all the dependent javascript libraries to play around with the User Interface.

Also, there is a jasmine [SpecRunner](SpecRunner.html) that runs all the unit tests.
Make changes to `SpecRunner.js` to add a new test.
